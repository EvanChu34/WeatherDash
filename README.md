# WeatherDash

## Basic Info
This Weather dashboard project is works with weather API. It uses OpenWeather API to get the data from the cities. It utilizes Jquery and Ajax calls to get the proper information.
When a user looks at the application, they will notice a search bar. When the user presses the search button, the city will be added to local storage and it will also add a button to a list under the search bar. It contains the searched city and when pressed it will display the current weather of the selected city. It will store as any buttons as possible and it will keep them there if you close the page and open it again. It also has a clear button in case you want to clear the data. The application will also give you a five day forcast in the form of cards on the bottom.
